Specifically, we show our method for place-cell-like SSP representations outperforms past methods. Using this representation, we efficiently learn the dynamics of a given plant over its state space. We implement this adaptive controller in a spiking neural network along with a classical sliding mode controller and prove the stability of the overall system despite non-linear plant dynamics. We then simulate the controller on a 3-link arm and demonstrate that the proposed representational method gives a simpler and more systematic way of designing the neural representation of the state space. Compared to previous methods, we show an increase of 1.23-1.25x in tracking accuracy."}],"skills":[{"name":"Languages and Frameworks","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Python","C","C++","C#","Java","Unreal Engine","Unity","Nengo","SNNTorch","PyTorch","ACT-R","Docker"]},{"name":"Topic Areas","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Neural Networks","Reinforcement Learning","Neuromorphic Computing","Artificial Intelligence","Cognitive Science","Dynamical Systems","Control Theory","Game Development"]}],"languages":[{"language":"English","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"Telugu","fluency":"Conversational","icon":""},{"language":"Spanish","fluency":"Basic"}],"interests":[{"name":"Philospohy","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Neoplatonism","Vedanta","Mysticism","Alfred North Whitehead","Spinoza","Alan Watts","Jiddu Krishnamurti","Aristotle","Plato","John Vervaeke"]},{"name":"Engineering","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Thousand Brains Theory","Dynamical Systems","Control Theory","Reinforcement Learning","Neural Networks","Neuromorphic Computing","Robotics"]}]}
